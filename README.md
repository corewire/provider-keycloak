# Provider keycloak

**IMPORTANT: This repo is no longer maintained and has been moved to https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-keycloak**

`provider-keycloak` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider that
is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/upbound/upjet) code
generation tools and exposes XRM-conformant managed resources for the
keycloak API.

Check out the examples in the `examples` directory for more information on how to use this provider.

## Current state
- Currently the provider is built here: https://gitlab.com/corewire/images/provider-keycloak and pushed to the gitlab container registry https://gitlab.com/corewire/images/provider-keycloak/container_registry/4538877
- Soon this provider will be moved to crossplane-contrib and published to upbound.
